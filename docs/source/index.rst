.. **RCR**, or Robust Chauvenet Rejection, is advanced, and easy to use, outlier rejection. Originally published 
.. in `Maples et al. 2018 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05276>`_, this site will 
.. show you how to use RCR in Python. RCR can be applied to weighted data 
.. and used for model-fitting, and we have incorporated rejecting 
.. outliers in bulk to have the best of both computational efficiency and accuracy (see the :ref:`install`).

.. RCR has been carefully calibrated, and extensively simulated. It can be 
.. applied to samples with both large contaminants and large contaminant 
.. fractions (sometimes in excess of 90% contaminated). Finally, because RCR 
.. runs on a C++ backend, it is quite fast.

.. Introduction
.. ------------
.. The simplest form of outlier rejection is sigma clipping, where measurements 
.. that are more than a specified number of standard deviations from the mean 
.. are rejected from the sample. This number of standard deviations should not 
.. be chosen arbitrarily, but is a function of your sampleâ€™s size. A simple 
.. prescription for this was introduced by William Chauvenet in 1863. 
.. Sigma clipping plus this prescription, applied iteratively, is what we call 
.. traditional Chauvenet rejection.

.. However, both sigma clipping and traditional Chauvenet rejection make use 
.. of non-robust quantities: the mean and the standard deviation are both 
.. sensitive to the very outliers that they are being used to reject. 
.. This limits such techniques to samples with small contaminants or small 
.. contamination fractions.

.. Robust Chauvenet Rejection (RCR) instead first makes use of robust 
.. replacements for the mean, such as the median and the half-sample mode, 
.. and similar robust replacements that we have developed for the standard 
.. deviation.

.. Basic Usage Example
.. -------------------
.. Here's a quick example of RCR in action: we have a dataset of :math:`N=1000` 
.. measurements, 85% of which are contaminants. The contaminants are sampled from
.. one side of a Gaussian/normal distribution with standard deviation :math:`\sigma=10`,
.. while the uncontaminated points are from a regular, symmetric Gaussian with :math:`\sigma=1`.
.. Both distributions are centered at :math:`\mu=0`.

.. The question is, how can we recover the :math:`\mu` and :math:`\sigma` of the underlying distribution, 
.. in the face of such heavy contamination? The example below shows how to do it with RCR.
