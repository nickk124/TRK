Installation Guide
==================

Python
------

Linux and macOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The easiest way to install TRK into Python is with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    python3 -m pip3 install trk

That's it; you're good to go from here!

.. The only requirement is ``pybind11``, but that should be taken care of with the pip installer. If not,
.. run ``python3 -m pip3 install pybind11``.

.. Alternatively, one could also download the C++ source code (see below), 
.. clone the `pybind11 Github repository <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_ into the same directory,
.. and compile everything into a Python module manually, but installing via pip as above is *much* easier.

Windows
^^^^^^^

Before installing, you'll need to have **Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0**, found 
under the `Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`_. 
If that doesn't work, you may need the latest `Windows SDK <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/>`_. 
(Both can be installed through the Visual Studio Installer.)

From here, install via ``pip`` from the terminal as usual:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    python3 -m pip3 install trk

(If you tried to install via ``pip`` without first installing the above requirements, ``pip`` would probably tell you to do so.)


C++
---
Because the TRK Python library uses pybind11 to wrap the original C++ source code seamlessly into Python, 
all of the speed of C++ is available through the Python library. However, if the C++ source code is desired, it
can be found at the `Github repository <https://github.com/nickk124/TRK>`_ in 
the ``src`` directory (``TRK_python.cpp`` is only used for wrapping the C++ code into the trk Python library, so it can be ignored).
Documentation specific to the C++ codebase can be found within the directory ``docs/cpp_docs`` of this repository.
